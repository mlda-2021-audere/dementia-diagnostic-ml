Dementia is a general syndrome for for the impaired ability to remember,
think or make decisions. In Singapore, 1 in 10 people above the age 
of 60 suffers from dementia, and this number is projected to affect up to 152,000 by 2030.
Although dementia is incurable syndrome, early identification of potential dementia allows
families and loved ones to start managing symptoms effectively during the early stages.

## Problem

Dementia consultation could be an increasing problem in society. Individuals may not receive
the immediate support and treatment they require. This could be due to several factors like
inconvenience, unavailability or even the high consultation fees to incur. This probes the
problem, how can we devise a solution to help curb this problem?

## Solution

Our team, Audere, has devised a solution to help families and loved ones conduct a Diagnostic
test at home, effectively eliminating the inconvenience and high cost for consultation. Our 
App takes in multiple factors like Age, Gender and Education. Similarly in the app, we induce 
a test called Mini Mental State Exam that helps calculate an individuals Mental State. With 
these factors, we formulate an effective predictor to help identify people who are at a severe
risk of having dementia.
